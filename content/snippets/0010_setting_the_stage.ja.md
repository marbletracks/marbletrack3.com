Squarehead leads Rabby, who drags a round circular plate onto the set.
Squarehead unties the ropes from Rabby.
Rabby squishes Squarehead as he heads toward the camera, knocking it off its stand.
By the time the camera is reset, Squarehead has recovered and is pulling the ropes out from under the wooden circle.

Candy Mama is one of the first characters on the set, and somewhat of a manager character.

She is pretty much no nonsense, but does have some compassion for her kids and other workers.

She was temporarily off the set after having a dizzy spell from being spun around too quickly, but got back to work in early 2019.

Her two sons work on the set.

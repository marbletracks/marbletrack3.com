Pinky is a character who was present in the first attempt at making Marble Track 3 6 years ago.  At that time was a little bit silly, but this time she's more grown up.

Some things she's done:

* April/May 2019: push medium blue marble from under the [Caret Splitter](/parts/caret-splitter/) up to the top of the [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection](/p/csfer).
* February 2019: Carry the [Triple Splitter Small Feeder Inner Bar Lower Support](/p/tssfibls) up the ramp

* February 2019: create [Decorative Walls](/p/pdw)
* November 2018: test the medium blue marble on the [Caret Splitter](/parts/caret-splitter/).  She found it works perfectly, but the small marble does not.

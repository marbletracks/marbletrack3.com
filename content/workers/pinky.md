Pinky is a character who was present in the first attempt at making Marble Track 3 6 years ago.  At that time was a little bit silly, but this time she's more grown up.

Some things she's done:

* February 2019: create [Decorative Walls](/p/pdw)
* November 2018: test the medium marble on the [Caret Splitter](/p/cs).  She found it works perfectly, but the small marble does not.

Pinky is a character who was present in the first attempt at making
Marble Track 3 in 2011.  At that time was a little bit silly, but
this time she's more grown up.

Some things she's done:

* March 2022: lifting [Zog Rails](/parts/zog-rails/), [Triple Splitter Small Feeder Inner Guider](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder-inner-guider/), and one of the [Lower Zig Zag 3F Rails](/parts/lower-zig-zag-3f-rails/)

* April/May 2019: push medium blue marble from under the [Caret Splitter](/parts/caret-splitter/) up to the top of the [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection/).
* February 2019: Carry the [Triple Splitter Small Feeder Inner Bar Lower Support](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder-inner-bar-lower-support/) up the ramp

* February 2019: create [Decorative Walls](/parts/decorative_walls_after_the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/)
* November 2018: test the medium blue marble on the [Caret Splitter](/parts/caret-splitter/).  She found it works perfectly, but the small marble does not.

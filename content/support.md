You can support Marble Track 3 Construction in a variety of ways.  Once Marble Track 3 Construction is finished, the person or entity who has given the most support will receive the actual Marble Track 3 track itself.

Monthly support can be given to [@MarbleTrack3 on Flattr](https://flattr.com/@marbletrack3), [Marble Track 3 on Donorbox](https://donorbox.org/marble-track-3-construction), or or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/marbletrack3). Patrons get to see snippets before the rest of the world, and can get access to *all* the frames of MT3 Construction.

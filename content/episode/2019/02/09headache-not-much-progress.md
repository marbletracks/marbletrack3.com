I think I got one picture done today.  28 minutes until the first
snapshot, and then the next two were no good or something.

Anyway, I had a headache from too much computering so will come back
to MT3 on Monday.

Here are the pics from today.  I think the middle two had to be
erased, or maybe the first 3?

Today I glued the
[Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection](/p/csfer) onto the
[Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Stanchion](/p/csfers) and
have a plan for a mini stanchion that is not yet named.

[Backpack Jack](/w/bpj) will carry the new piece, which was cut from
the top of the
[Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Stanchion](/p/csfers) and
floated in midair for perhaps too long until he could grab it.

[G Choppy](/w/gc) has cut the
[Ninth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/p/9poss) with his first backswing
chop, not easily seen in the movie because it is on the opposite side
of the stage from the camera, and it takes less than a second to
complete.  [Reversibly Guy](/w/rg) is holding the piece cut from the
top of the [Ninth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/p/9poss), which he
will soon take over to be the [Caret Splitter](/p/cs)'s
[Right Hand Inner Side](/p/csrhis), although he needs to move quickly
as the stage is turning the Caret Splitter away from the camera.

[Pinky](/w/pinky) has nearly completed her [Decorative Walls](/p/pdw) and
will soon jump off the stage to immediately reappear on the other side
with a circle to finish them.

About to be on the camera-side of the stage, [Candy Mama](/w/cm) is
leaning down, about to lift the
[First Triple Splitter Small Feeder Bar](/p/1tssfb) along with the
[Second Triple Splitter Small Feeder Bar](/p/2tssfb) so
[Mr Greene](/w/mg) can test the small orange marble on the
[Lower Zig Zag](/p/lzz), which should be just about perfectly in front
when the marble rolls down.

[Lil Brother](/w/lil) is still spinning on top of the
[Triple Splitter](/p/ts).  I don't know if I will have him fall down
or just walk up the [Triple Splitter Small Feeder](/p/tssf) once it is
in place, and have him spin on top of that.

Here are frames taken today.

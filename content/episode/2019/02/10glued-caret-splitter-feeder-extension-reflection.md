Today I glued the
[Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection/) onto the
[Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Stanchion](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection-stanchion/) and
have a plan for a mini stanchion that is not yet named.

[Backpack Jack](/w/bpj) will carry the new piece, which was cut from
the top of the
[Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Stanchion](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection-stanchion/) and
floated in midair for perhaps too long until he could grab it.

[G Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/) has cut the
[Ninth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/009p_ninth-placed-outer-spiral-support/) with his first backswing
chop, not easily seen in the movie because it is on the opposite side
of the stage from the camera, and it takes less than a second to
complete.  [Reversibly Guy](/workers/reversible/) is holding the piece cut from the
top of the [Ninth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/009p_ninth-placed-outer-spiral-support/), which he
will soon take over to be the [Caret Splitter](/parts/caret-splitter/)'s
[Right Hand Inner Side](/parts/caret-splitter-right-hand-inner-side/), although he needs to move quickly
as the stage is turning the Caret Splitter away from the camera.

[Pinky](/workers/pinky/) has nearly completed her [Decorative Walls after the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/decorative_walls_after_the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/) and
will soon jump off the stage to immediately reappear on the other side
with a circle to finish them.

About to be on the camera-side of the stage, [Candy Mama](/workers/candy_mama/) is
leaning down, about to lift the
[Triple Splitter Small Feeder Inner Bar](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder-inner-bar/) along with the
[Triple Splitter Small Feeder Outer Bar](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder-outer-bar/) so
[Mr Greene](/workers/mr_greene/) can test the small orange marble on the
[Lower Zig Zag](/parts/lower_zig_zag/), which should be just about perfectly in front
when the marble rolls down.

[Little Brother](/workers/lil_brother/) is still spinning on top of the
[Triple Splitter](/parts/triple_splitter/).  I don't know if I will have him fall down
or just walk up the [Triple Splitter Small Feeder](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder/) once it is
in place, and have him spin on top of that.

Here are frames taken today.

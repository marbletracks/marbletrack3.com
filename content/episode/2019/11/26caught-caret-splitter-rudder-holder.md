Today [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) caught the [Caret Splitter Rudder Holder](/parts/caret-splitter-rudder-holder/) which will soon be part of the [Caret Splitter Rudder](/parts/caret-splitter-rudder/), which should fall from the sky soon.

[Little Brother](/workers/lil_brother/) has run onto the set and is climbing onto [Squarehead](/workers/squarehead/) as [Squarehead](/workers/squarehead/) runs along the edge of the stage, this time away from the switch after [Doctor Sugar](/workers/dr_sugar/) toggled the rotation direction.

[Mr Greene](/workers/mr_greene/) has brought [el Lifty Lever](/parts/el-lifty-lever/) onto the set, and will soon drill a hole into it (how??).

Oh and [Mr McGlue](/workers/mr_mcglue/) has a standin today as he is walking through the [Triple Splitter Small Feeder](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder/), [Lower Zig Zag](/parts/lower_zig_zag/).

Oh and finally, I have decided to rename the [Lower Zig Zag](/parts/lower_zig_zag/) parts as LZZ1F - LZZ3F respectively, which now makes more sense to me than LZZ1B - LZZ3B.

I will rename them later.

Later!

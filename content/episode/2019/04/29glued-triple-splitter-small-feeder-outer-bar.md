This was a relatively quick livestream in which I was just able to
glue the [Triple Splitter Small Feeder Outer Bar](/p/tssfob) before I
had to go.

##### 11:56 Monday 29 April 2019 JST

The next day, I noticed the [outer bar](/p/tssfob) was glued a little bit higher
than the [inner bar](/p/tssfib) on the
[Triple Splitter Small Feeder](/p/tssf).  Small marbles still rolled
down it, but I figured it would be better if flatter so I took [a few
minutes to explain the problem and fix it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHFbmVwOSZU).

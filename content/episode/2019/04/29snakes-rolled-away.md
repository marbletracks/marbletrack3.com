After a couple of misfires with my computer acting like it could not
keep up with all its tasks, I rebooted and tested the small orange
marbles rolling down the [Triple Splitter Small Feeder](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder/) to
the (top of the) [Triple Splitter](/parts/triple_splitter/), where they immediately fall
onto [the Triple Splitter Small Marble Catcher](/parts/the_triple_splitter_small_marble_catcher/), down onto
the [Little Wiggly Track](/parts/little_wiggly_track/) and finally to the
[Right Side Small Landing Zone](/parts/right_side_small_landing_zone/).

They worked perfectly! (So long as someone ([Mr McGlue](/workers/mr_mcglue/) stood
where the lower end of [The Outer Spiral](/parts/outer_spiral/) will be, allowing the
marbles to bounce off him and remain between the rails of the
[Triple Splitter](/parts/triple_splitter/).)

As of this writing, just after the Triple Splitter Small Feeder has
been placed:

* The snakes have rolled away after [Big Brother](/workers/big_brother/) bumped into
  them with the Large Orange Marble.
* Squarehead has just seen the snakes and is jumping back in surprise.
* Super Spoony has just started up the ramp carrying two Small
  Marbles, which will be used to show the characters testing the
  sequence I tested above.
* Candy Mama is able to move again, which allows Big Brother to move
* Big Brother is now pushing the Large Orange Marble up toward the
  Triple Splitter.
* Reversible Guy is now able to move again and has gotten out of the
  way of Mr Greene
* Mr Greene is carrying a plank which was blocking the
  [Right Side Small Landing Zone](/parts/right_side_small_landing_zone/) so it can be used as the
  not yet existing Triple Splitter Small Feeder Feeder.  I am not yet
  sure it will in fact be called that nor even exist soon.  He might
  end up using it to shovel marbles up during the upcoming test.
* [Little Brother](/workers/lil_brother/) has jumped over to the
  [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension](/parts/caret_splitter_feeder_extension/)
* [Pinky](/workers/pinky/) is pushing the Medium Blue Marble up toward the
  [Caret Splitter](/parts/caret-splitter/), so will bump into Little Brother soon.

After some false starts, I got a decent amount of work done today.
Primarily, I cut and glued the
[Seventh Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/007p_seventh-placed-outer-spiral-support/).  Secondarily, I
planned what [Backpack Jack](/w/bpj) will do next: get the support for
the [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection/), which will
be installed by [Squarehead](/w/square) soon.

Today's livestream was split into 3 segments, <!-- given that today is the
first day after New Year's eve celebrations last night. --> the second livestream
(an hour long) is featured above.  The [first segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_bCbcVJRaY) and [third
segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-o5PIPV5O4) were about 30 minutes each.

The great news: I think I got the [Medium Catcher Below Triple Splitter](/parts/medium-catcher-below-triple-splitter/)
connected to the [Back Right Medium Landing Zone](/parts/back_right_medium_landing_zone/).  They are connected by [Guides into Back Right Medium Landing Zone](/parts/guides-into-back-right-medium-landing-zone/). I have not tested them yet though.

The oops news: I broke the [Upper Splitter off the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/upper_splitter_off_the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/) and
had to reglue it.

Today [G-Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/) began his walk across the not-yet-placed
[Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection/) on his way to
cut the
[Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Stanchion](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection-stanchion/),
being held by [Backpack Jack](/w/bpj).

The livestream got interrupted by work, but I got six frames taken,
but the second to last below had to be reshot because Backpack Jack
had fallen.

As of this writing, I have written all the actions that the characters
have performed in the 10th take, which is the 7th video in
[the playlist of silent snippets](https://mt3s.marbletrack3.com).

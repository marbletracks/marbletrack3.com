At the start of
[today's first livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH6YdvTf7N8)
I discovered that the piece I glued yesterday had been glued too low,
so I had to reglue it.  I reglued it then ate lunch while waiting for
the glue to dry.

At the start of
[today's second livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur8z9FkeVgo)
(same as inline above), I realized I could have ignored the incorrect
positioning and continued taking frames.

The second livestream did not last long before I stopped it to let
different glue dry.

The sixth vertical toothpick in the [Lower Zig Zag Net](/parts/lower_zig_zag_net/) is
waiting for its glue to dry.  This toothpick is standing vertically
held in place with a pipe cleaner twisted like a paperclip.

Today G Choppy cut the
[Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Stanchion](/p/csfers) as
activity took place all around him.

Pinky is still working on the decorative walls.

[Big Brother](/w/big) is pushing the large orange marble up away from
the [Snake Plate U-turn Berm Bar](/p/sputbb).

Dr Sugar is headed off the set via the ramp while Candy Mama has just
come up the ramp with the [2nd Triple Splitter Small Feeder](/p/2tssf).  The
Triple Splitter Small Feeders will be put in place vaguely soon,
probably before the Outer Spiral is even really started.

[Lil Brother](/w/lil) is spinning on the top of the [Triple Splitter](/p/ts).

Mr Greene is testing the small orange marble on the
[Lower Zig Zag](/p/lzz), after just having put in place the
[Lower Zig Zag Net](/p/lzzn) along with Dr Sugar.

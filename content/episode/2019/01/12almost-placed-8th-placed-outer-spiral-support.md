I took some time to measure the length and positions of
[Eighth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/008p_eighth-placed-outer-spiral-support/) and [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Stanchion](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection-stanchion/) by putting the [os](/parts/outer_spiral/)
on the track to make sure it would all work.

At the same time, I bumped the ramp, so I decided to tape it to the
desk so it won't move much.

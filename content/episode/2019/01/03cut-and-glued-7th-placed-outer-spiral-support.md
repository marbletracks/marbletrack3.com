Pretty good progress today, with over 1 second worth of video frames
taken.  I got stuck near the end because several characters were all
converged around the [7th Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/007p_seventh-placed-outer-spiral-support/) which
has now been cut, and the traffic jam is soon to be untangled.

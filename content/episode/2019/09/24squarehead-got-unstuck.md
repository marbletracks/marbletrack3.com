Happy Birthday Dad!

Today I streamed nearly 3 hours, and got four full seconds of frames
taken because there was not a lot going on, but that which was going
on is fantastic!

Happily for [Squarehead](/workers/squarehead/), he got his hands unstuck from the [Ninth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/009p_ninth-placed-outer-spiral-support/) In
completely unexpected news, [Squarehead](/workers/squarehead/) has stood up sideways on the track!

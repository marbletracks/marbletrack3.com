During each hour of today's livestream, I took enough frames for about 1 second of video.

The construction during the animation was slower than I guessed, but I think the animation itself looks pretty good.  Today [G Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/) floated down the right side of the [Caret Splitter](/parts/caret-splitter/) and then arranged himself so he could cut the [Caret Splitter Feeder Lefter Guider](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-lefter-guider/).

[Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) helped with that, and as of this writing the [Caret Splitter Feeder Lefter Guider](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-lefter-guider/) is glued in place, although I have not taken any photos for the video with the Left Guider in place.

In the midground, [Mr McGlue](/workers/mr_mcglue/) finished gluing the [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Protection](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection-protection/) to its [Lower Holder](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection-protection-lower-holder/), and is now gluing the same to the [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Protection Upper Holder](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection-protection-upper-holder/).

In the sideground, [Squarehead](/workers/squarehead/) is trying to get his hand unstuck from the track so he can go do whatever he is supposed to be doing.

In the background, [Big Brother](/workers/big_brother/) pushed the Large Green Marble up past the [Snake Plate U Turn](/parts/snake_plate_u_turn/), and is now pushing it up the [Triple Splitter](/parts/triple_splitter/).  He will let the Large Green Marble roll down [Triple Splitter](/parts/triple_splitter/), [Snake Plate U Turn](/parts/snake_plate_u_turn/), (forgot the name track), [Lowest Largest U-Turn](/parts/lowest_largest_u_turn/), and [The First Track](/parts/the_first_track/), and find the marble makes it down to the bottom of The First Track no problem, but it might actually roll off the end of The First Track, so we may have to add a bumper of some sort there.

In the background behind Big Brother, [Candy Mama](/workers/candy_mama/) retrieved the Small Orange Marble and is ostensibly doing something related to testing the [Lower Zig Zag](/parts/lower_zig_zag/).

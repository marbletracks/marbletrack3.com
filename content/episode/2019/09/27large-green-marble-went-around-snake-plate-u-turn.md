Today's livestream ended up in two parts because my computer stopped
working (ran out of space on `/dev` and others), but it was readily
cleared up by rebooting the machine.

The
[first livestream from today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cOXDsc0OVc)
is setup and then me noticing the camera was not working.

I took five frames today, during which the green marble went around
the [Snake Plate U Turn](/parts/snake_plate_u_turn/)

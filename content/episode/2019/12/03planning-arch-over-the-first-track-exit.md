Not many frames taken today, but I made *great* headway in planning
what will be a cool effect of the [Caret Splitter Rudder](/parts/caret-splitter-rudder/) fluttering
down into the hands of [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/), fully 3 seconds from now in the video.

I suspect it will not be finished until 2020, unless I can get a
lot of hours done this holiday season.  (The Caret Splitter Rudder Flutter finished in late January 2020.)

In other news, I designed the shape of [The Grand Archway](/parts/the-grand-archway/).

The arch has to fit the space so it's tall enough to support the [Outer Spiral](/parts/outer_spiral/),
and wide enough to allow me to grab marbles from [The First Track](/parts/the_first_track/) and the
[Front Left Medium Landing Zone](/parts/front_left_medium_landing_zone/)

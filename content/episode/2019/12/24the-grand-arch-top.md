Today I spent some time stabilizing the camera; it had gotten bumped
in the week of not filming.

I made shoes by cutting corners from a balsa box and glued them to the
camera shelf as shoes for its tripod feet to keep from moving.  Then I
glued the shelf to the desk.

After that I took about 13 frames, 8 of which were useful.

[G Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/) flew up onto [Triple Splitter Small Feeder](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder/) while [Pinky](/workers/pinky/) flipped off the stage to get
the small orange marble.  Meanwhile [Little Brother](/workers/lil_brother/) flipped onto the stage to put
the [Below Lower Zig Zag U-turn](/parts/below-lower-zig-zag-u-turn/) berm in place.

I am half done with the flutter.  I got to frame 21 of 40 yay!

Today most of the time was spent adding little numbered strips of
paper to the track so I can ensure it rotates at the right speed for
the [Caret Splitter Rudder](/parts/caret-splitter-rudder/) to flutter
down to [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) so he can catch it
without really moving as the stage rotates with him on it.

I suspect it will take me some weeks or maybe months to realize this
plan.  I think it will look awesome.

After marking the points on the stage and the screen, I took a break
and then came back and filmed about 5 frames fluttering, visible at
the end of this clip.

Today I streamed for a bit over an hour and got the second orange
marble started rolling down the [Triple Splitter Small Feeder](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder/).  [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) is watching the first orange marble rolling down, and about to turn back to maybe watch the second one.  [Squarehead](/workers/squarehead/) is jumping back in fear after seeing the large red marble tumble off the track.  [Pinky](/workers/pinky/) has just let the blue marble go down the [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection/) and it has now made it to the [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension](/parts/caret_splitter_feeder_extension/).

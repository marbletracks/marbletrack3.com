Today
[G Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/)
began curving
[Triple Splitter Small Feeder Inner Guider](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder-inner-guider/)
while
[Pinky](/workers/pinky/)
prepares to pull herself up to help install the pieces.

In the foreground
[Candy Mama](/workers/candy_mama/)
has delivered
[Zog Rails Support](/parts/zog-rails-support/)
to
[Doctor Sugar](/workers/dr_sugar/)
who is holding it now until
[Mr McGlue](/workers/mr_mcglue/)
can get over there to glue it.

She is now about to leave the track, and take two pieces which were
cut from the
[Sixteenth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/sixteenth-placed-outer-spiral-support/)
and
[Seventeenth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/seventeenth-placed-outer-spiral-support/)
I think.

She actually might stay on the track to install those pieces
somewhere.  I haven't decided yet.

[Mr McGlue](/workers/mr_mcglue/)
is now headed to
[Mr Greene](/workers/mr_greene/)
to glue the
[Eighteenth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/eighteenth-placed-outer-spiral-support/)
in place.

Okay, regarding
[Candy Mama](/workers/candy_mama/)
I think the best plan would be for her to turn around, discover the
stage has rotated too far for her to go down the ramp, turn back
around and install the two pieces.

However, Future Rob might decided to do otherwise.  I'll leave it up
to him.

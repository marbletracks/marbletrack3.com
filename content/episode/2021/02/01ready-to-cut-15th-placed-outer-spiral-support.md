Today I only streamed one hour, but set it up for the next several
frames to go pretty well I hope.

[Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) is up to the [Fifteenth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/fifteenth-placed-outer-spiral-support/) to hold it in place, and because it was wiggling
around so much as I removed it from [Mr Greene](/workers/mr_greene/)'s head, I hung it from above,
which required some adjustments to one of the horizontal steels
trusses and and carving a groove into a tongue depressor.

[G Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/) is coming up to cut the chopstick [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) is holding so it can be glued by [Mr McGlue](/workers/mr_mcglue/) once he is done gluing the [Lower Left Side Arch](/parts/lower-left-side-arch/) and the [Autosticks](/workers/autosticks/) around the [Caret Splitter Right Track](/parts/caret_splitter_right_track/).

In the back of the stage from the camera, [Pinky](/workers/pinky/) is still moving small marbles up the [Lower Zig Zag 2F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-2f/).

In front of that, [Mr Greene](/workers/mr_greene/) is pushing the large marble up the [Triple Splitter](/parts/triple_splitter/) and will soon let it go so we can see the marble lifting [el Lifty Lever](/parts/el-lifty-lever/) and see [El Banderín](/parts/el-banderín/) move along with it.

[Little Brother](/workers/lil_brother/) is still spinning near [El Banderín](/parts/el-banderín/) while standing on [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection/) above the [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Second Stanchion](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection-second-stanchion/).

Here are the frames taken today, the first three of the last four of
which had to be retaken as the last frame:

As predicted, having the [Fifteenth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/fifteenth-placed-outer-spiral-support/) suspended by a thread let filming proceed quickly today.  [G Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/) arrived at the [Fifteenth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/fifteenth-placed-outer-spiral-support/) and extended his arm for 3 frames and then I cut the [Fifteenth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/fifteenth-placed-outer-spiral-support/) and glued it in place.

For some reason, I mis-measured the cut and had to do it twice.

The glue is dry by now as I write this, and while drying was held in placed by the demonstration [Outer Spiral](/parts/outer_spiral/).

In other news, there was a stick visible in the last taken frame from Monday, so I had [Squarehead](/workers/squarehead/) bring it in, though I don't have a plan for him *per se*.

[Autosticks](/workers/autosticks/) have finished moving themselves in place for the [Caret Splitter Right Track](/parts/caret_splitter_right_track/), and [Mr McGlue](/workers/mr_mcglue/) has finished gluing one end of the [Lower Left Side Arch](/parts/lower-left-side-arch/).

Here are the frames taken today:

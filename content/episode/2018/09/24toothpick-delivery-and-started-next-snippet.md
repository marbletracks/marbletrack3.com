Today was split into two livestreams, though both were quite short.  I
got a piece glued behind the Caret Split, and had toothpicks delivered
by Mr Shikatama for use in the [Lower Zig Zag](/parts/lower_zig_zag/)

Here is Toothpick Delivery, the longest version of the sixth snippet
in the original silent mt3s.robnugen.com playlist.

The rest of the livestream is here

glued the stick behind the Caret Split.

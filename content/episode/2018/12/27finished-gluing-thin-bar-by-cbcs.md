Today was mostly a planning session.  I wrote several notes to my
future self:

* [Candy Mama](/workers/candy_mama/) hold [Bar Below Circle by Caret Splitter](/parts/bar_below_circle_by_the_caret_splitter/) (finished as of
  this entry)
* [Mr McGlue](/workers/mr_mcglue/) glue lower end of [Bar Below Circle by Caret Splitter](/parts/bar_below_circle_by_the_caret_splitter/)
  (finished as of this entry)
* [Pinky](/workers/pinky/) bring chopstick to [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/)
* [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) get chopstick from [Pinky](/workers/pinky/) (to be used as Outer Spiral Supports)
* Autosticks move into place for [Lower Zig Zag Net](/parts/lower_zig_zag_net/)
* [G-Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/) cut other autosticks on [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension](/parts/caret_splitter_feeder_extension/)
* [Mr Greene](/workers/mr_greene/) test [Lower Zig Zag Net](/parts/lower_zig_zag_net/) with small marble
* [Big Brother](/workers/big_brother/) push medium green marble up U-turns to test Triple Splitter
* [Squarehead](/w/square) install [guides](/parts/two-ends-chopped-off-triple-splitter/) on [Medium Catcher Below Triple Splitter](/parts/medium-catcher-below-triple-splitter/)

I took seven frames today, all of which seem good to be used in the final video.  Funny thing: [Pinky](/workers/pinky/) was off screen for just two frames and magically appeared on the other side of the set with a chopstick.  I did that with the hopes that [G-Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/) can cut the [7th Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/007p_seventh-placed-outer-spiral-support/) while that side of the stage is in view.

The [7th Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/007p_seventh-placed-outer-spiral-support/) will support the [Triple Splitter Small Feeder](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder/).

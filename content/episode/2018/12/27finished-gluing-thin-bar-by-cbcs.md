Today was mostly a planning session.  I wrote several notes to my
future self:

* [Candy Mama](/w/cm) hold [Bar Below Circle by Caret Splitter](/p/bbcbcs) (finished as of
  this entry)
* [Mr McGlue](/w/mmg) glue lower end of [Bar Below Circle by Caret Splitter](/p/bbcbcs)
  (finished as of this entry)
* [Pinky](/w/pink) bring chopstick to [Reversible Guy](/w/rg)
* [Reversible Guy](/w/rg) get chopstick from [Pinky](/w/pinky) (to be used as Outer Spiral Supports)
* Autosticks move into place for [Lower Zig Zag Net](/p/lzzn)
* [G-Choppy](/w/gc) cut other autosticks on [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension](/p/csfe)
* [Mr Greene](/w/mg) test [Lower Zig Zag Net](/p/lzzn) with small marble
* [Big Brother](/w/big) push medium green marble up U-turns to test Triple Splitter
* [Squarehead](/w/square) install [guides](/p/tecots) on [Medium Catcher Below Triple Splitter](/p/mcbts)

I took seven frames today, all of which seem good to be used in the final video.  Funny thing: [Pinky](/w/pinky) was off screen for just two frames and magically appeared on the other side of the set with a chopstick.  I did that with the hopes that [G-Choppy](/w/gc) can cut the [7th Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/007p_seventh-placed-outer-spiral-support/) while that side of the stage is in view.

The [7th Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/007p_seventh-placed-outer-spiral-support/) will support the [Triple Splitter Small Feeder](/p/tssf).

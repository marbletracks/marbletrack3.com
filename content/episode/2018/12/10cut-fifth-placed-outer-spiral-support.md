Today I hung the top of the bar [G Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/) cut last livestream,
the [Fifth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/005p_fifth_placed_outer_spiral_support/).  The top of the bar remained
suspended in air for 6 frames, or 1/2 of a second of playback time,
and [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) has just caught it.

But the trickiest bit was at the back of the stage!  Trying to get the
[Lower Zig Zag Net](/parts/lower_zig_zag_net/) in place required some patience to get
the pieces in place.  The space is quite small, and the pieces even
smaller.  I've got little toothpicks moving around, trying to be glued
from underneath the lowest bar of the [Lower Zig Zag](/parts/lower_zig_zag/)

I took 7 frames today, none of which were immediately slated for
deletion.

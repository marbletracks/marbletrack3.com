Today I got 7 frames taken in under 2 hours.  Not a lot, but I got two
pieces glued, including another toothpick for the
[Lower Zig Zag Net](/parts/lower_zig_zag_net/) and the newly named
[Circle by the Caret Splitter](/parts/circle_by_the_caret_splitter/).

The trickiest bits today dealt with toothpicks; they kept falling,
repeatedly, and were a general nuisance to deal with.

Right now, the demo outer spiral is on the track so I can figure out
where to place the [Sixth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/006p_sixth_placed_outer_spiral_support/), but
it has not been placed yet.  I plan to put it at an angle from the
stage just inside the [Left Side Small Landing Zone](/parts/left_side_small_landing_zone/).

In other news, I finished a page of plans, reminders of what is
supposed to happen "next" on the track, for various definitions of
next.

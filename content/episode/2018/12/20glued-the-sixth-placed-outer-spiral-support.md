Today G Choppy cut the [Sixth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/006p_sixth_placed_outer_spiral_support/) which will soon glued by Mr McGlue.  On the other side of the track, Lil Brother is holding the
[Medium Catcher below Triple Splitter](/p/mcbts) until Mr McGlue can glue *it* as well.

Of the frames taken today, I think two had to be deleted.

Before starting to set up the next frame, I took some time to write
down what each of the characters should be doing next.  While I want
to write the plans in here as a TODO list of sorts, I need the list on
paper in front of me while I work on the track.  I doubt I will keep
up with both, but that would be cool.

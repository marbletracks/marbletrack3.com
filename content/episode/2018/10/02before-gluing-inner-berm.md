Today, my three hour live stream culminated with me gluing the inner
berm for the medium marble just below the Caret Splitter while two
more ramps for the [Lower Zig Zag](/parts/lower_zig_zag/) are being brought in by a
rarely seen character with white body and green head.

The part of Mr McGlue was taken over again by the original Mr McGlue,
after maybe 10 or so frames with the stand-in Mr McGlue.

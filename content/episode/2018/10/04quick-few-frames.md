Short livestream today during which I had just enough time to check
the Inner Left Guide for the Caret Splitter (ILG4CS) (featured in
title image of this episode).

After testing the ILG4CS, I had enough time to take a few frames,
which I posted below.

The unnamed white guy with green head has just delivered short
popsicle sticks(*) which will be used in the [Lower Zig Zag](/parts/lower_zig_zag/).
I think I will make him ghostable.  He will be working with Dr Sugar,
who is apparently *not* ghostable, so it will be a good combination to
have their differing styles of motion working together.

Hopefully they can get a good bit of the Lower Zig Zag completed while
it is passing by in front of the camera.

Here is the latest snippet: the first 7+ seconds of the 7th snippet,
including the images below!

Altogether, MT3 livestreams have lasted 10 days so far.

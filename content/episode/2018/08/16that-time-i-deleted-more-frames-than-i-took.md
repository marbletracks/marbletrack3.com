After taking 6 frames and watching the resulting output, I deleted 7
or 8 frames to reshoot them.

Basically the small marble catcher below the triple splitter needs
more support before it can properly catch marbles.

I need to record the snake swiping a small marble off the splitter,
but there is no support, so I gotta put the support up before the
snake does the swipe, and do the swipe before I put the support up
because the small marble keeps making the support sag downward.

In reality, that means I either have to delete 25 frames (not likely
to happen) or work out a way to hide support until [Dr Sugar](/workers/dr_sugar/) can add
support.

Here are frames taken and then *deleted* today.

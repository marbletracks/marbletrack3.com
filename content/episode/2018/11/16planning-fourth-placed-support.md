I planned the [Fourth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/4poss) a couple
days ago.  Been busy on Version 2 of the website so did not write this
entry right after doing the live stream.

There was another live stream the same day, where I got
[Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) closer to placing the Fourth Support.

Today was super slow progress, getting about 7 frames done in 1.75
hours or so.

Main issue was having so many characters active at the same time!  I
realized after the first frame that I had not moved the Autosticks
(toothpicks) toward the [Caret Splitter Feeder](/parts/caret_splitter_feeder/), so they are paused
for about 4 or 5 frames.  I am sure it will be fine, though.

I have added reminders to move them over the next several frames.

The most interesting reminder though was to remind myself to work on
the Medium Catcher below the Triple Splitter.  I want to work on it
while that part of the track is in front of the camera.  I calculated
it takes 88 frames to move the stage all the way around.  The stage
needs to move 5/12ths of the way around, so about 40 frames from now I
should be thinking about making that track, so I need to bring some
characters now to work on it.  What indeed should they have?  Maybe
little brother can work on it with some ice cream spoons.

Today Squarehead has started bringing the [Caret Splitter Feeder](/parts/caret_splitter_feeder/) up
the ramp that Big Brother just put into place.

G Choppy has just cut the Fourth Placed Outer Spiral Support and is
headed toward Reversible Guy who will soon place the Fifth Placed
Outer Spiral Support.

Mr McGlue is currently gluing the Fourth Placed Outer Spiral Support.

In the background, Mr Greene and Dr Sugar are working on the Lower Zig
Zag Net, for which I have not yet figured out how to make the
toothpicks cut themselves.

Today the livestream was split over two videos.

Today I glued the [Fourth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/004p_fourth_placed_outer_spiral_support/) after
[G Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/) cut it.

In the background the orange marble has rolled off the top of the
[Lower Zig Zag](/parts/lower_zig_zag/), where [Mr Greene](/workers/mr_greene/) is going to help
build an LZZ Catcher.

Here are the frames from today.  Just 3 in 30 minutes; the first one
was missing something!

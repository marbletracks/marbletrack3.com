After buying thread at Pandora House near 新百合ヶ丘駅, I retired some
lengths of the previous thread which is thicker (and slightly darker
(than the background)), but hanging
[G Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/)
from it proved to be so fiddly
that I decided to try using an armature for it, and ended up having to
stop the livestream (while glue dries) after gluing two paris of
alligator clip sticks together to make the armature actually workable.

Today
[Mr Greene](/workers/mr_greene/)
started to turn back after he realized he had seen the
[Small Marble Saver](/parts/small-marble-saver/)
debris hanging above his head.

[Mr McGlue](/workers/mr_mcglue/)
is gluing the lower end of the
[Triple Splitter Small Feeder Inner Guider](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder-inner-guider/)
in place, and has maybe 4
more frames to go before he can move up to the upper end of the
[Triple Splitter Small Feeder Inner Guider](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder-inner-guider/).

[Candy Mama](/workers/candy_mama/)
has just walked down the third ramp, and
SMG
is just about to walk
up to glue the
[Nineteenth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/nineteenth-placed-outer-spiral-support/)
and
[Twentieth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/twentieth-placed-outer-spiral-support/)..
but
[Doctor Sugar](/workers/dr_sugar/)
has to quickly put them in their right spots!

[Backpack Jack](/workers/backpack_jack/)
is doing a little shimmy to thread
ZOGS
through the front arch.

[Pinky](/workers/pinky/)
is just about to move the
[Triple Splitter Small Feeder Outer Guider](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder-outer-guider/)
into place, which I'm hoping can be glued and stay in place (on her
feet) while filming next time.

Here are frames taken during this livestream:

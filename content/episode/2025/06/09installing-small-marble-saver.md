Today is the day I forgot to take a photo of the
[Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Stanchion](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection-stanchion/)
before ripping it out so I could re-place it about 1mm from where it had been
blocking medium marbles from flowing down
[the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/)

The removal and replacement went quite smoothly, and saved Marble
Track 3 from an existential crisis:  If I had determined the
characters would have to remove and reglue the
[Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Stanchion](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection-stanchion/),
or if the
removal had destroyed part of the track, ...  I dunno, but I was
tempted to just say bah and toss it all.

During the video I took *one* (1) frame, a recent low in terms of
frames per hour of livestreaming.   1 frame in 3.75 hours, so 0.265
frames per hour.  Woooo!

At the end of the livestream, all the characters are scattered about
the set, so first thing in the next stream will be to bring them back
into order.

One frame taken today:

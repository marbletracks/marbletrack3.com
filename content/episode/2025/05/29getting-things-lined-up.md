In Real Life, I moved, changed jobs, started a book, and more, all
while Marble Track 3 waited patiently!  Most importantly, the camera
and set stayed intact while I moved.  It took a while to get the
camera pointing in the right direction, but that was the ahem, focus
of this livestream.

After just over three years of chilling, Marble Track 3 construction is back!

Next steps are to get the characters back in their places so we can start filming.

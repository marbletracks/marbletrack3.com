Real life happens as it does, and fortunately, the camera and studio stayed intact while I moved.  It took a while to get the camera pointing in the right direction, but that was the ahem, focus of this livestram.
After just over three years of chilling, Marble Track 3 construction is back!

Next steps are to get the characters back in their places so we can start filming.

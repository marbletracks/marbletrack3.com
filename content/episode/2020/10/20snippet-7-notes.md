These are Snippet 7 X-Sheet notes, which might help me document what happened in the 7th snippet.  These are copied from Dragonframe 4 X-Sheet notes from all the frames.

Linebreaks are preserved in the [source of this file in git](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marbletracks/marbletrack3.com/master/content/episode/2020/10/20snippet-7-notes.md), but I killed the `pre` tags so it would not take ages to scroll through on the site.

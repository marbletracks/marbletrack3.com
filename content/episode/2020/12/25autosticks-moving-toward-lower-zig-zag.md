Today the [Autosticks](/workers/autosticks/) in stage front were consistently the easiest
characters to work with.  They did not quite make a tight enough turn
to go up the switch, so I had them begin to loop around like a figure
8.

The the same time, the second [Autostick](/workers/autosticks/) which had already gotten up onto the
[Lower Zig Zag](/parts/lower_zig_zag/) was tricky to work with, and actually ended up stopping filming
today because I had to wait for its glue to dry.

Near there, [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) got the [Fourteenth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/fourteenth-placed-outer-spiral-support/) put nearly into place so [G Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/) can cut it
at the right height soon.

The beginning of the livestream saw me untying the two bars that will
support [El Banderín](/parts/el-banderín/) which revealed that one was too twisty and had to be reset.
The reset did not take long.

During filming, [Little Brother](/workers/lil_brother/) started to raise [El Banderín](/parts/el-banderín/) so he can put it on top of its
sticks.

I uploaded a snippet today, the last ten frames or so were taken
today.

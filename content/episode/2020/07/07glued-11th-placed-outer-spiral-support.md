The weather is getting hotter.  Normally no problem, but my computer
was heating up.  Turning on the AC caused a piece floating on a string
to blow around, so I put a curtain in front of the AC to baffle its
buffeting.

[Big Brother](/workers/big_brother/) is carrying the [Triple Splitter Medium Catcher Ridge](/parts/triple-splitter-medium-catcher-ridge/) up onto the set as [Pinky](/workers/pinky/) tests the [Lower Zig Zag](/parts/lower_zig_zag/) with
a small orange marble.

[Mr Greene](/workers/mr_greene/) has been holding the large green
marble in place for a while and I decided it was because he needed to
make sure the small orange marble can go past it.  Yay!  Soon he will
let the large green marble roll down to test [el Lifty Lever](/parts/el-lifty-lever/).

[Little Brother](/workers/lil_brother/) has been spinning for a while and will stop now that he has seen
that the small orange marble is rolling down the [Lower Zig Zag](/parts/lower_zig_zag/).

[Backpack Jack](/workers/backpack_jack/) is headed down the ramp and [Candy Mama](/workers/candy_mama/) will follow soon.

[Doctor Sugar](/workers/dr_sugar/) has just noted the stage is not rotating quickly enough so
will tap it again with the stick he is holding before going to get the
2nd arch.  [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) is now bringing up some more pieces to ~be outer spiral~  2nd bridge
supports.  I think #13 is next.

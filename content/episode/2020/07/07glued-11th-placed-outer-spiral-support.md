The weather is getting hotter.  Normally no problem, but my computer
was heating up.  Turning on the AC caused a piece floating on a string
to blow around, so I put a curtain in front of the AC to baffle its
buffeting.

Big is carrying the csmcr up onto the set as pinky tests the lzz with
a small orange marble.

Mrgreene has been holding the large green
marble in place for a while and I decided it was because he needed to
make sure the small orange marble can go past it.  Yay!  Soon he will
let the large green marble roll down to test ell.

Lil has been spinning for a while and will stop now that he has seen
that the small orange marble is rolling down the lzz.

BPJ is headed down the ramp and CM will follow soon.

Drsugar has just noted the stage is not rotating quickly enough so
will tap it again with the stick he is holding before going to get the
2ndarch.  RG is now bringing up some more pieces to be outer spiral
supports.  I think #13 is next.

Today in two hours of livestream, I was overall super productive for
the construction of Marble Track 3 and took *zero* frames of video!

The main best thing was preparing the placement of [The Lowest Longest Separator](/parts/the-lowest-longest-separator/) which will
hopefully keep small marbles on [the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/) after they go left down the
[Caret Splitter](/parts/caret-splitter/).  This piece should hopefully keep them from falling onto [The First Track](/parts/the_first_track/).  

Okay, so in addition to [The Lowest Longest Separator](/parts/the-lowest-longest-separator/), I cut two thin bamboo pieces to be
the [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Lower Right Protection](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection-lower-right-protection/) and the [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Lower Left Protection](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection-lower-left-protection/) respectively, though I didn't take a
photo of the latter.

The easiest piece to actually make today was the [Triple Splitter Medium Catcher Ridge](/parts/triple-splitter-medium-catcher-ridge/), which basically ensures the
medium marble will reverse its direction after falling through the
[Triple Splitter](/parts/triple_splitter/).

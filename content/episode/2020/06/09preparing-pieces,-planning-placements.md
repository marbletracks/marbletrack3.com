Today in two hours of livestream, I was overall super productive for
the construction of Marble Track 3 and took *zero* frames of video!

The main best thing was preparing the placement of a stick to
hopefully keep small marbles on tlsms after they go left down the
CS.  This piece should hopefully keep them from faling onto tft.  I
don't have a name for it yet, but maybe First Track Lowest
Small-Medium Splitter Separater, following the pattern "A B Separater"

Oh how about Lowest Longest Separater?  It's short, accurate,
semi-memorable.

Okay, so in addition to that piece, I cut two thin bamboo pieces to be
the CSFERLRP and the CSFERLLP respectively, though I didn't take a
photo of the first one.

The easiest piece to make was the TSMCR, which basically ensures the
medium marble will reverse its direction after falling through the
ts.

This was the first of two 1-hour livestreams today.  After getting [G Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/)
fully onto the track, it became apparent that I would have to figure
out how to adjust the [Lower Zig Zag 2F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-2f/) support next to [Lower Zig Zag 1F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-1f/) so small marbles would not hit it.

Meanwhile, [Mr Greene](/workers/mr_greene/) continued moving under [el Lifty Lever Guider](/parts/el-lifty-lever-guider/) to lift [el Lifty Lever](/parts/el-lifty-lever/) so [Candy Mama](/workers/candy_mama/) could help push the large marble under [el Lifty Lever](/parts/el-lifty-lever/).  Next, I need to figure out what to attach to the top of [el Lifty Lever](/parts/el-lifty-lever/) so it can actually do something useful.

After some trial and error with scissors, Bill's knife, and the
grinder stone on my Dremel, I recalled I have a router cutter for my
Dremel which worked perfectly.  Awesome!

During all that cutting though, I moved the entire track so had to
re-set it on the stage.  Then I realized I had to do some more cutting
so I would have to move it again.

Here are the frames I took during this livestream:

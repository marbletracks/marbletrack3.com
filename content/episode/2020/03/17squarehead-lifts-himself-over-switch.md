Today, [Squarehead](/workers/squarehead/) continued to not hit the switch as the stage pulls him around.  I am wondering about having him go all the way around the set, maybe while all the other guys go to lunch?

I forgot to have [Pinky](/workers/pinky/) watch the medium green marble as it went down the [Medium Catcher Below Triple Splitter](/parts/medium-catcher-below-triple-splitter/) under the [Triple Splitter](/parts/triple_splitter/).   I am not going to retake the frames though because..

Dealing with [G Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/) and [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) flying was made easier with the maglevs, but still pretty tricky as they tended to spin any which direction.  I spent a great deal of time making a smaller maglev system for [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) because I need to move him laterally across the track and his old maglev cannot do it.

Here are the frames from today.. one had to be deleted.

For a few weeks I have been fluttering the [Caret Splitter Rudder](/parts/caret-splitter-rudder/) down to [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/).  Last week he
caught it and today he attached it to the [Caret Splitter Rudder Lever Spinner](/parts/caret-splitter-rudder-lever-spinner/).

I was super happy with the way [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) looked in the frames before and
after the thing was attached.  Despite Jennie jumping up onto the set,
it looks super smooth!

(I did not take a picture of her but now I realize I should have just
so you guys could see her on the set.)

Great progress toward finishing the seventh snippet today.  [Candy Mama](/workers/candy_mama/) and [Squarehead](/workers/squarehead/) have just about brought the [Second Bridge Level 1](/parts/second-bridge-level-1/) into place, and [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) and [Pinky](/workers/pinky/) have placed the [Second Bridge Supports](/parts/second-bridge-supports/) under it for [Mr McGlue](/workers/mr_mcglue/) to glue.

There was very nearly a disaster as I swapped [Mr McGlue](/workers/mr_mcglue/) with shoes for [Mr McGlue](/workers/mr_mcglue/) without shoes: a block of magnets fell from the lighting area and landed right on [The First Track](/parts/the_first_track/), fortunately not breaking either the [Lowest Largest Backtracking Chopstick](/parts/lowest_largest_backtracking_chopstick/) or [First Snake-Installed Rail](/parts/first_snake-installed_rail/) which holds the [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Second Stanchion](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection-second-stanchion/).

Right now two of the [Second Bridge Supports](/parts/second-bridge-supports/) are drying on half of the [Second Bridge Level 1](/parts/second-bridge-level-1/).  I needed to pause streaming while that glue dries.

Here are the frames taken during this livestream today.

Today I took 6 frames in 59 minutes 45 seconds of livestream.  With
the film running at 12 frames per second, this amounts to just
slightly over 1/2 of a second of film per hour of livestream.

[G Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/) has cut [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/)s vertical stick a second time to create [Second Bridge Supports](/parts/second-bridge-supports/) as [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) and [Candy Mama](/workers/candy_mama/) prepare to
make [Second Bridge Level 1](/parts/second-bridge-level-1/).

Meanwhile, [Little Brother](/workers/lil_brother/) has finished his backbend and is about to stand up on
the [Right Side Small Landing Zone](/parts/right_side_small_landing_zone/).

In the mid-ground, [Mr Greene](/workers/mr_greene/) has just released the large green marble which is
lifting [el Lifty Lever](/parts/el-lifty-lever/) for the first time on the film.

I took 7 frames today, all of which I intend to use in the film.

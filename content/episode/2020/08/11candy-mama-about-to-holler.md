After getting off to a slow start I made pretty good progress on
filming for marble track 3 today.

[G Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/) has made it all the way down to the stage and has just cut the
stick that [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) has been holding.  The two pieces already
cut are still up in the air; I'm not sure how I'm going to get them
down.

I had the idea to have [Candy Mama](/workers/candy_mama/) call for everyone to come help build
the [Second Bridge Level 1](/parts/second-bridge-level-1/).  after she calls, the two brothers are going to run
away to try to get out of work.  [Pinky](/workers/pinky/) and [Mr Greene](/workers/mr_greene/) will come help,
along with [Doctor Sugar](/workers/dr_sugar/) probably.

While they are working on the second bridge I will keep the stage
rotating with almost nobody on it.  Once the [Second Bridge Level 1](/parts/second-bridge-level-1/) is finished
that will be the end of the 10th snippet which I have been working on
for a long time now.

I'm planning to work on the track again tomorrow.

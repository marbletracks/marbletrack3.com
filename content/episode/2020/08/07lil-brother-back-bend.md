I don't recall details from this except that [Little Brother](/workers/lil_brother/) did a
backbend to get himself safely away from [G Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/)'s sword.  [G Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/) is floating
down and cut the top of the stick [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) is holding.  These will be the
[Second Bridge Supports](/parts/second-bridge-supports/).

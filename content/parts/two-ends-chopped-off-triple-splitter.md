These pieces were removed from the [Triple Splitter](/parts/triple_splitter/) because they stuck
too far past the edge the stage.  At the time of their removal, there
was no specific plan to use them.

Over a year later in realtime, and about 10 minutes later in
movie-time, they were picked up by Squarehead to act as supports /
[guides](/parts/guides-into-back-right-medium-landing-zone/) on the [Medium Catcher Below Triple Splitter](/parts/medium-catcher-below-triple-splitter/).

History:

* 2019 Jan 01: These became [Guides into Back Right Medium Landing Zone](/parts/guides-into-back-right-medium-landing-zone/)

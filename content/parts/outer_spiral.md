The outer spiral hasn't fully been created. I have created the demo Outer Spiral, shown in the image.  The plan is for the real outer spiral to pass large and medium marbles onto the [Triple Splitter](/parts/triple_splitter/), without affecting any of the track below.

I want the large and medium marbles to roll smoothly around the entire track at least once, and possibly twice, but I will probably prefer to make the continuation of this track curve smoothly inside the middle area of Marble Track 3 instead.

History:

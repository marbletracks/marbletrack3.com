This piece separates the [Lower Zig Zag](/parts/lower_zig_zag/) from the [Triple Splitter Small Feeder](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder/) because the point at which
they are closest, the tracks are headed opposite directions.  This
only became apparent once the [Lower Zig Zag 3F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-3-ban/) was installed, and was much higher
than I had expected.

Once it was determined the space was too small to make a switch from
[Lower Zig Zag 3F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-3-ban/) to either [Lower Zig Zag 2F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-2-ban/) or [Triple Splitter Small Feeder](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder/), adding this piece was a load off our minds.  The space was super tight, but the small marbles can fit just well enough.

History:

* 2020 February 18: installation via Autosticks, monitored by [Candy Mama](/workers/candy_mama/).

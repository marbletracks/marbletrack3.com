History:

The Seventh Placed Outer Spiral Support stands just outside the lower curve below [Lower Zig Zag](/parts/lower_zig_zag/) (I think).

* 2019 Jan 03: The Seventh Placed Outer Spiral Support has been glued into place.

[![2019 Jan 03 cut and glued 7th poss](//b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/construction/2019/thumbs/2019_jan_03_cut_and_glued_7th_poss.jpg)](//b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/construction/2019/2019_jan_03_cut_and_glued_7th_poss.jpg)

* 2019 Jan 01: The chopstick is fully handed over to [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) who will put it in place with support from [Mr Greene](/workers/mr_greene/).

* 2018 Dec 27: Walking up the ramp, [Pinky](/workers/pinky/) started bringing the
  chopstick for this piece.

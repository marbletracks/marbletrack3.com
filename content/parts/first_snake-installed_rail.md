The First Snake-Installed Rail keeps medium sized marbles on
[the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/)
after they go down the shorter leg of the
[Caret Splitter](/parts/caret-splitter/).
It does *not* keep small marbles on
[the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/).

This rail runs somewhat above
[The First Track](/parts/the_first_track/),
and is just barely out of the way of Large Marbles running on
[The First Track](/parts/the_first_track/).

Starting from the front of the track, near the shorter leg of the
[Caret Splitter](/parts/caret-splitter/),
The First Snake-Installed Rail
supports the
[Lower Curver off the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/lower_curver_off_the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/),
two thirds (2/3) of the way along its length.

It was tricky to put this rail into the right place given the characters I had on hand, so I brought in two Snakes so they could hold it steady while the other characters installed supports and glued it in place.


History:

* future to be augmented further by [The Lowest Longest Separator](/parts/the-lowest-longest-separator/)

* Dec 2018 augmented by [Bar Below Circle by Caret Splitter](/parts/bar_below_circle_by_the_caret_splitter/)

* Nov 2018 works fine for medium marbles, but it does *not* work for Small Marbles

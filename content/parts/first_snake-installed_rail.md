It was tricky to put this rail into the right place given the characters I had on hand, so I brought in two Snakes so they could hold it steady while the other characters installed supports and glued it in place.  This piece runs right above [The First Track](/parts/the_first_track/), and is just barely out of the way of Large Marbles, and in the way of Medium Marbles.

History:

* future to be augmented further by [The Lowest Longest Separator](/parts/the-lowest-longest-separator/)
* Dec 2018 augmented by [Bar Below Circle by Caret Splitter](/parts/bar_below_circle_by_the_caret_splitter/)
* Nov 2018 works fine for medium marbles, but it does *not* work for Small Marbles

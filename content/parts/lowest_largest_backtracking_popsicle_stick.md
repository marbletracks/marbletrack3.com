This is a single rail which guides the Largest Marble down from the [Snake Plate U-Turn](/parts/snake_plate_u_turn/) to the [Lowest Largest U-Turn](/parts/lowest_largest_u_turn/).

When I placed it, I put it too close to its partner the [Lowest Largest Backtracking Chopstick](/parts/lowest_largest_backtracking_chopstick/) for them to really focus on their task of guiding the large marbles, plus the characters big feet get stuck in the gap, so this piece is annoyingly placed.

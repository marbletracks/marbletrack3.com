The [Lower Zig Zag](/parts/lower_zig_zag/) is made of multiple thin sticks which need rails on the side to keep the marbles on the track.  The Lower Zig Zag 2F Guardrails start at the [Lower Zig Zag 2F top](/parts/lower-zig-zag-2-ban-top/) with two sticks emanating from below the [Lower Zig Zag 2F Bouncer](/parts/lower-zig-zag-2f-bouncer/).

Those two sticks were not enough to keep the balls on the tracks, so an [Autosticks](/workers/autosticks/) has joined the guardrail team.

History:

* 2020 Dec 22: [Pinky](/workers/pinky/) helped an [Autostick](/workers/autosticks/) know where to go

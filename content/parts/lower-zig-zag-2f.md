History:

* 2020 Dec 01: [Pinky](/workers/pinky/) brought marbles up to test the [Lower Zig Zag](/parts/lower_zig_zag/) but one of them fell. [Autosticks](/workers/autosticks/) are on the way in to extend the rails.

* 2020 Jun 10: [G Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/) cut a notch into the upper support of the Lower Zig Zag 2F allowing small marbles on the [Lower Zig Zag 1F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-1f/) to pass by smoothly.

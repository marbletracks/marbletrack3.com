This landing zone balances the [Front Left Medium Landing Zone](/parts/front_left_medium_landing_zone/), and
will eventually be fed by the [Triple Splitter](/parts/triple_splitter/).  It has a toothpick
placed at an angle to keep marbles from rolling back once they arrive
at the end.

#### Construction history

* 01 Jan 2019: [Doctor Sugar](/workers/dr_sugar/) has placed the first (of two?) [Guides into Back Right Medium Landing Zone](/parts/guides-into-back-right-medium-landing-zone/).
* 20 Dec 2018: [Little Brother](/workers/lil_brother/) is holding [Medium Catcher Below Triple Splitter](/parts/medium-catcher-below-triple-splitter/) until Mr McGlue can glue it in place.
* 15 Nov 2018: this landing zone is not yet connected to the Triple Spliter.  That's somewhat of a problem because the [Lower Zig Zag](/parts/lower_zig_zag/) makes it hard to put anything under the Triple Splitter, much less a medium track.  Good thing it only needs to be short and straight.

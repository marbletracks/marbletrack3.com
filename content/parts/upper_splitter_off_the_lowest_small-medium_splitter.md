This is a small curved track that pushes medium marbles to the left, away from the [First Snake-Installed Rail](/parts/first_snake-installed_rail/).

Along with the [Lower Curver off the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/lower_curver_off_the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/), this guides medium marbles from [the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/) to the [Front Left Medium Landing Zone](/parts/front_left_medium_landing_zone/).

History:

* 01 Jan 2019: [broken (and reglued)](/episode/2019/january/guardrail-into-back-right-medium-landing-zone/) while trying to plan where track will go after [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension](/parts/caret_splitter_feeder_extension/).

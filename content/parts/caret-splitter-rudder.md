The Caret Splitter Rudder is as yet an imaginary piece which will be
toggled by medium marbles to ensure make small marbles go to the left
or right down the [Caret Splitter](/p/cs).

But, because medium marbles can only go down the left hand side of the
caret splitter, the toggling of Caret Splitter Rudder must ensure that
the medium marbles do not go toward the Caret Splitter Rudder unless
it is pushed toward the right, which will push them toward the left.

History:

* 2019 Feb 10: planned to be made above [Caret Splitter](/p/cs)

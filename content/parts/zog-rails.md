Zog Rails are two thin bamboo bars which will extend from [Lower Zig Zag 3F Rails](/parts/lower-zig-zag-3f-rails/) to guide small marbles from beyond [Zog](/parts/zog/), over [Zog](/parts/zog/) and onto the [Lower Zig Zag 3F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-3f/).

Zog Rails will be supported by [Zog Rails Support](/parts/zog-rails-support/)

History:

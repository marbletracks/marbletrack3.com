The Caret Splitter Right Hand Inner Side should keep small marbles on
track once they eventually can use the right hand side of the
[Caret Splitter](/p/cs).  The plan is to use something like a rudder
([Caret Splitter Rudder](/p/csr), anyone?) to push the pieces
towa... oh that won't work well UNLESS the medium marbles push the
rudder and ensure they themselves will only go down the track IFF the
rudder is pushed toward the right, to send them down toward the left.


History:

* 2019 Feb 10: Decided to be a piece which would go on the right hand
  side of the [Caret Splitter](/p/cs)

* 2019 Feb 09: Held by [Reversible Guy](/w/rg) after [G Choppy](/w/gc)
  cut it from the top of the
  [Ninth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/p/9poss)

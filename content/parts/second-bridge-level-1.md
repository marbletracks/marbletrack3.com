The Second Bridge will allow characters to come onto the set from the left side.  All of its levels will be flat.  Its entrance(s) will be off the set, out of the camera's view. Its first level will be the same height as the stage.

I plan for the second level to be approximately twice as high, perhaps as high as the top of the [Triple Splitter](/parts/triple_splitter/), or as high as the top of the [Triple Splitter Small Feeder](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder/)

History:

* 2020 Jul 26: [Backpack Jack](/workers/backpack_jack/) arriving with Second Bridge supports as [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) holds the first
  up to be cut by [G Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/)

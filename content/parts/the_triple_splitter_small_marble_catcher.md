This catches small marbles almost immediately after they hit the [Triple Splitter](/parts/triple_splitter/).  This hangs from the Triple Splitter, suspended above the [Back Right Medium Landing Zone](/parts/back_right_medium_landing_zone/).  It sends marbles down to the [Right Side Small Landing Zone](/p/rsslz).

History:

* 29 Apr 2019: small marbles now roll out properly, but they have not yet been fully tested within the final film.

* 15 Nov 2018: small marbles do not roll out from under the Triple Splitter onto the [Little Wiggly Track](/p/lwt/), but they should.

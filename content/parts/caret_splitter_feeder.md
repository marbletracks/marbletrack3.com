The Caret Splitter Feeder sends small and medium marbles to the [Caret Splitter](/parts/caret-splitter/).

In the future, it will extend back to the [Outer Spiral](/parts/outer_spiral/) via [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension](/parts/caret_splitter_feeder_extension/).

History:

* 2018 Dec: successfully tested by [Pinky](/workers/pinky/) using the blue medium marble

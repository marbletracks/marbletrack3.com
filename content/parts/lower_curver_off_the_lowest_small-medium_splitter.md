This is just a bit of track essentially parallel to the [Left Side Small Landing Zone](/parts/left_side_small_landing_zone/).

Along with the [Upper Splitter off the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/upper_splitter_off_the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/), this guides medium marbles from [the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/) to the [Front Left Medium Landing Zone](/parts/front_left_medium_landing_zone/).

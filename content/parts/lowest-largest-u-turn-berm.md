The [Lowest Largest U-Turn](/parts/lowest_largest_u_turn/) is too tight for large marbles to stay on
the track, so it needs a berm.  The berm will be made of pieces cut
from [Caret Splitter Feeder Guider](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-guider/) and [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Protection](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection-protection/).

History:

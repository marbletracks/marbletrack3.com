History:

* 2020 Jun 02: [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) installed [el Lifty Lever Guider](/parts/el-lifty-lever-guider/) around el Lifty Lever

* 2019 Nov 19: [Mr Greene](/workers/mr_greene/) started carrying it onto the set.  Jimmy helped name the piece.  I had tentatively called it Large Marble Liftee.

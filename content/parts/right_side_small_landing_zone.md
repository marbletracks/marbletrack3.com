This landing zone is only for small marbles.  
It is fed by the [Little Wiggly Track](/parts/little_wiggly_track/) and the [Below Lower Zig Zag Track](/parts/below_lower_zig_zag_track/),
which should eventually be connected with a switch near [Triple Splitter Small Feeder](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder/) and [Lower Zig Zag 3 ban](/parts/lower-zig-zag-3-ban/).

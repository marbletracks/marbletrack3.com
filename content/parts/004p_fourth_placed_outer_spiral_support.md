This piece is the first to not be placed at the full height it needs
to be for the [Outer Spiral](/parts/outer_spiral/), but will first hold the
[Caret Splitter Feeder](/parts/caret_splitter_feeder/) and then be extended vertically a
bit to hold the Outer Spiral.

The Fourth Placed Outer Spiral Support was glued into place near the
end of the aptly named livestream

History:

* 29 Nov 2018: the piece is in place, and has been glued by [Mr McGlue](/workers/mr_mcglue/).

* 20 Nov 2018: though [Mr McGlue](/workers/mr_mcglue/) is listed as having
helped, and the piece has been glued, [Mr McGlue](/workers/mr_mcglue/) has not actually glued
the piece in place in the snippet (Take 10 in Dragonframe, Snippet 7
in [mt3s](https://mt3s.marbletrack3.com)).

This small piece of bamboo keeps marbles on [Lower Zig Zag 3F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-3f/) headed into the [Lower Zig Zag 3F 2F Net](/parts/lower-zig-zag-3f-2f-net/).

The [Triple Splitter Small Feeder Inner Guider](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder-inner-guider/) will extend from this piece down along the [Triple Splitter Small Feeder](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder/).

History:

* 2020 Feb 18: Installed by [Candy Mama](/workers/candy_mama/) and glued by [Mr McGlue](/workers/mr_mcglue/), officially canceling

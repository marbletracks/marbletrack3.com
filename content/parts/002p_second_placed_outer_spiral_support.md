This piece stands outside the [Snake Plate U-Turn Berm](/parts/snake_plate_u_turn_berm/).  It was placed by [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) who caught the upper end which [G Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/) cut off.  That upper end became the [Third Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/003p_third_placed_outer_spiral_support/), on the opposite side of the stage, near the [Decorative Walls after the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/decorative_walls_after_the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/)

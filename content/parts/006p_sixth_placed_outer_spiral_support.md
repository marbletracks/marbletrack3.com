This piece stands at an angle from just inside the [Left Side Small Landing Zone](/parts/left_side_small_landing_zone/)

History:

* 20 Dec 2018: [G Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/) cut the piece which will soon be glued in place by [Mr McGlue](/workers/mr_mcglue/)
* 17 Dec 2018: decided to put it just inside the [Left Side Small Landing Zone](/parts/left_side_small_landing_zone/)
* 04 Dec 2018: miscounted the [Fifth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/005p_fifth_placed_outer_spiral_support/) as this one

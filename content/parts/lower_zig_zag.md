The Lower Zig Zag currently has a [zig](/parts/lower-zig-zag-2-ban/) and a [zag](/parts/lower-zig-zag-1-ban/).  I had planned to make it have 3 or 4 zigs and zags, but there simply was not room to have that many back and forth tracks in the (original) vertical space.

But *above* the original space, there is more space.

History:

* May 2019: Now planning to make [Lower Zig Zag 3F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-3-ban/), a third bar (and another zag) for Lower Zig Zag.
* 2018 Sep: planning the Lower Zig Zag:

From the top, it will appear in a very narrow zone.

From the side, it will look like this:

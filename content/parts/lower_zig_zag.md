The Lower Zig Zag currently has three levels: [1F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-1f/), [2F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-2f/), and [3F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-3f/), using the naming convention of buildings in Japan.

Originally planned to accept marbles from the [Triple Splitter Small Feeder Feeder](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder-feeder/),
that plan was canceled by the installation of the [Lower Zig Zag 3F Net Affector](/parts/lower-zig-zag-3f-net-affector/) because the [Lower Zig Zag 3F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-3f/) was too high (and pointing the wrong way) to allow such a transition to work.

History:

* 2021 July 06: [Pinky](/workers/pinky/) tested two marbles running down three levels of the Lower Zig Zag then onto the [Right Side Small Landing Zone](/parts/right_side_small_landing_zone/).  Everything worked just fine.

* 2020 Feb 18: [Candy Mama](/workers/candy_mama/) installed the [Lower Zig Zag 3F Net Affector](/parts/lower-zig-zag-3f-net-affector/), which guides marbles down to [Lower Zig Zag 2F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-2f/), away from [Triple Splitter Small Feeder](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder/).

* May 2019: Now planning to make [Lower Zig Zag 3F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-3f/), a third bar (and another zag) for Lower Zig Zag.

* 2018 Sep: planning the Lower Zig Zag:

From the top, it will appear in a very narrow zone.

From the side, it will look like this:

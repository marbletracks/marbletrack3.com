Lower Zig Zag 3F Rails will connect to [Zog Rails](/parts/zog-rails/)
to help small marbles transition from
[Zog](/parts/zog/) to
[Lower Zig Zag 3F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-3f/).

History:

* 2022 Mar 15: [Pinky](/workers/pinky/) lifted herself up onto [Triple Splitter Small Feeder Outer Bar](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder-outer-bar/) while holding one of the Lower Zig Zag 3F Rails, [Triple Splitter Small Feeder Inner Guider](/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder-inner-guider/), and [Zog Rails](/parts/zog-rails/).

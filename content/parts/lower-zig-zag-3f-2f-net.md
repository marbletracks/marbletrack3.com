These vertical toothpicks catch small marbles as the transition from
[Lower Zig Zag 3F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-3-ban/) to [Lower Zig Zag 2F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-2-ban/).  Should not be confused with [Lower Zig Zag Triple Splitter Small Feeder Separator](/parts/lower-zig-zag-triple-splitter-small-feeder-separator/).

History:

* 2020 March 24: Autosticks finished installation as [Candy Mama](/workers/candy_mama/) monitors their progress.

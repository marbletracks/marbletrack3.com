Paul is a 10x10mm square length of hardwood, 192mm in length.  It was probably a scrap of wood from somewhere.  Curiously, it has a hole through one end of it, and a notch at the other end.  I plan to place it with the bored hole at the top, in case it can be used to support something.

I plan to mount it between [Caret Splitter Feeder](/parts/caret_splitter_feeder/)
and
[the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/)

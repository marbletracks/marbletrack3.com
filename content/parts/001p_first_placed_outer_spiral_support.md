This is not the first support for the Outer Spiral in terms of size or distance from either end of the [Outer Spiral](/parts/outer_spiral/).  It is the first support that was installed to support the Outer Spiral.

This piece fell from the sky into [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/)'s hand because he needed it at that moment to add the [Backboard](/parts/caret-splitter-backboard/) for the [Caret Splitter](/parts/caret-splitter/). To get it to fall from the sky I had to think of a reasonable explanation.  There is a scene that explains it, but that scene will only be available on the DVD (or to Patreon patrons).

* 20 Sept 2018 chopstick fell from the sky.

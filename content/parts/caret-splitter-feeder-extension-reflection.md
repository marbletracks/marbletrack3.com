This piece will essentially roll small and medium marbles from the
middle of the track to bounce off the [outer spiral](/parts/outer_spiral/) and then into the
[Caret Splitter](/p/cs) via its [Extension](/p/csfe) and [Feeder](/p/csf).

Will be supported by the [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Stanchion](/p/csfers).

History:

* 2019 Feb 05: Nearly put in place by [Squarehead](/w/square).

* 2019 Jan 02: Using the demonstration [Outer Spiral](/parts/outer_spiral/) to decide where exacle [Squarehead](/w/square) should place the piece.

Glued to [Second Circle Below Caret Splitter](/parts/second-circle-below-caret-splitter/), this long bamboo piece extends to [Sixth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/006p_sixth_placed_outer_spiral_support/) and has a
slight angle as it passes the the [Lower Curver off the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/lower_curver_off_the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/) so it can be closer to the
small marbles.

It may be the case that this piece not close enough to the [the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/) to
keep small marbles on it from falling to [The First Track](/parts/the_first_track/)

Glued to [Second Circle Below Caret Splitter](/parts/second-circle-below-caret-splitter/), this long bamboo piece extends to
[Third Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/003p_third_placed_outer_spiral_support/)
and has a
slight angle as it passes the [Lower Curver off the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/lower_curver_off_the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/) so it can be closer to the
small marbles.

This piece keeps small marbles on
[the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/)
from falling to [The First Track](/parts/the_first_track/)

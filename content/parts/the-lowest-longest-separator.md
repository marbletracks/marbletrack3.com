(not to be confused with the shorter (and lower)
[Bar Below Circle by Caret Splitter](/parts/bar_below_circle_by_the_caret_splitter/).)

Glued to [Second Circle Below Caret Splitter](/parts/second-circle-below-caret-splitter/), this long bamboo piece extends to
[Third Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/003p_third_placed_outer_spiral_support/)
and has a
slight(!) angle as it passes the [Lower Curver off the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/lower_curver_off_the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/) which brings it closer to the
small marbles.

This piece keeps small marbles on
[the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/)
from falling to [The First Track](/parts/the_first_track/) along [The First Track](/parts/the_first_track/)'s *entire* length (which [Bar Below Circle by Caret Splitter](/parts/bar_below_circle_by_the_caret_splitter/) was too short to do).

Starting from the front of the track, near the [Caret Splitter](/parts/caret-splitter/),
The Lowest Longest Separator
passes below the
[Lower Curver off the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/lower_curver_off_the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/),
two thirds (2/3) of the way along its length.

Its lower end *almost* touches the
[Third Placed Outer Spiral Support](/parts/003p_third_placed_outer_spiral_support/).

History:

* 2020 Oct 27: Nearly installed by [Mr Greene](/workers/mr_greene/) and [Backpack Jack](/workers/backpack_jack/) as [Candy Mama](/workers/candy_mama/) has come up the other side to help.

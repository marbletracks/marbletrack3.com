El Banderín is a flag attached via poles to [el Lifty Lever](/parts/el-lifty-lever/) so that it is moved when marbles lift [el Lifty Lever](/parts/el-lifty-lever/) and thereby allow other marbles to continue on their journeys past El Banderín.

History:

* 2021 Jan 02: [Mr McGlue](/workers/mr_mcglue/) glued El Banderín to its poles

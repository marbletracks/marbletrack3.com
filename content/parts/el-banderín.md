El Banderín will be a piece attached to [el Lifty Lever](/parts/el-lifty-lever/) so that it is moved when marbles lift [el Lifty Lever](/parts/el-lifty-lever/) and thereby allow other marbles to continue on their journeys past El Banderín.

History:

* 2020 Dec 01: Brought onto the set by [Mr Greene](/workers/mr_greene/) and [Little Brother](/workers/lil_brother/)

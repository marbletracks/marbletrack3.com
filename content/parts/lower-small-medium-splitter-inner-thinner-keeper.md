Hopefully will help keep marbles on [the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/) by keeping them from bouncing off the [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Stanchion](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection-stanchion/) and ricocheting onto [The First Track](/parts/the_first_track/).

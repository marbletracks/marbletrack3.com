The Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Stanchion will support
the [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection](/p/csfer)

History:

* 2019 Jan ?: Cut by G Choppy
* 2019 Jan 13: nearly put in place by Backpack Jack, but he will have
  to hold it for a while until [G. Choppy](/workers/g_choppy/) can cut it to size.

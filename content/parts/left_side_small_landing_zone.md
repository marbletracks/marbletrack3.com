This landing zone is fed by the [Caret Splitter](/parts/caret-splitter/) and [Lowest Back Left Small Marble Curve](/parts/lowest_back_left_small_marble_curve/).

On its front-pointing end, small marbles arrive from the [Caret Splitter](/parts/caret-splitter/) while on its back end, marbles roll in by [Pinky's Decorative Walls](/parts/decorative_walls_after_the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/).

The [Outer Spiral](/parts/outer_spiral/) runs above, supported by The [Lower Left Side Arch](/parts/lower-left-side-arch/).

This track is only for the small marbles, leading them quite quickly from the [Caret Splitter](/parts/caret-splitter/) entrance to the [Left Side Small Landing Zone](/parts/left_side_small_landing_zone/).

As of this writing (Nov 2018) small marbles get stuck there and cannot move forward.  I have a few ideas of how to fix it, but am not sure if they will work.

* 25 Jan 2021 [Autosticks](/workers/autosticks/) are  on their way to build a structure here to keep small marbles on the track.

* 12 Jan 2021 [Candy Mama](/workers/candy_mama/) has just placed the [Lower Left Side Arch](/parts/lower-left-side-arch/), beginning to block easy access to the Caret Splitter Right Track.  [Autosticks](/workers/autosticks/) will come soon to help.

* 22 Feb 2019 [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) brought [Caret Splitter Right Hand Inner Side](/parts/caret-splitter-right-hand-inner-side/) to Caret Splitter Right Track

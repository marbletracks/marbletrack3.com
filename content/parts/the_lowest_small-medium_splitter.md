Starting diagonally opposite
[Triple Splitter](/parts/triple_splitter/),
the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter is a
long track next to The First Track.
It cannot handle large marbles like
[Triple Splitter](/parts/triple_splitter/)
but it guides small and medium marbles
after they come down the left (shorter) side of the
[Caret Splitter](/parts/caret-splitter/).

Its first guard rail is
[Bar Below Circle by Caret Splitter](/parts/bar_below_circle_by_the_caret_splitter/)
which worked for medium sized marbles, but didn't work for small marbles.

Its second guard rail is
[The Lowest Longest Separator](/parts/the-lowest-longest-separator/)
which keeps small marbles from falling onto
[The First Track](/parts/the_first_track/).

At the lower end, its third guard rail is
[Small Marble Saver](/parts/small-marble-saver/)
which prevents small marbles from falling into
a little hole after
[Lower Curver off the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter](/parts/lower_curver_off_the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/).



Its fourth guard rail DNE as of 9 June 2025 will
(probably) connect from [Paul](/parts/paul/) to [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Stanchion](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection-stanchion/) and Backpack Jack will soon start bringing it into place.


History:

* 2025 Jun 9:

Upon testing, I discovered medium sized marbles could not pass
[Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Stanchion](/parts/caret-splitter-feeder-extension-reflection-stanchion/)
because [The Lowest Longest Separator](/parts/the-lowest-longest-separator/) forced them into the Stanchion.

* Nov 2018: small marbles going down the left side of the [Caret Splitter](/parts/caret-splitter/) cannot make the transition from Caret Splitter to this track.  They fall onto [The First Track](/parts/the_first_track/), passing under the [First Snake-Installed Rail](/parts/first_snake-installed_rail/).

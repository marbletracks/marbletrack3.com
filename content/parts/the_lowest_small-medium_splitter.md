This is a long track next to The First Track, but for small and medium marbles after they come down the left side of the [Caret Splitter](/parts/caret-splitter/).

History:

* Nov 2018: small marbles going down the left side of the [Caret Splitter](/parts/caret-splitter/) cannot make the transition from Caret Splitter to this track.  They fall onto [The First Track](/parts/the_first_track/), passing under the [First Snake-Installed Rail](/parts/first_snake-installed_rail/).

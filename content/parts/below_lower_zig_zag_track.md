This is a short segment of track that runs under the [Snake Plate U Turn](/parts/snake_plate_u_turn/).  It guides marbles from the [Lower Zig Zag](/parts/lower_zig_zag/) to the [Right Side Small Landing Zone](/parts/right_side_small_landing_zone/).

As of this writing, it is inaccessible, because the supports of the [Snake Plate U-Turn Berm](/parts/snake_plate_u_turn_berm/) block marbles coming from the Lower Zig Zag.

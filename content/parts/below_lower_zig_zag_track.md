This is a short segment of track that runs under the [Snake Plate U Turn](/parts/snake_plate_u_turn/).  It guides marbles from the [Lower Zig Zag](/parts/lower_zig_zag/) to the [Right Side Small Landing Zone](/parts/right_side_small_landing_zone/).


History:

* 2019 Dec 18: [Pinky](/workers/pinky/) tested it as [Little Brother](/workers/lil_brother/) brought up a wall to fix it.

* 2018 Nov: inaccessible, because the supports of the [Snake Plate U-Turn Berm](/parts/snake_plate_u_turn_berm/) block marbles coming from the Lower Zig Zag.

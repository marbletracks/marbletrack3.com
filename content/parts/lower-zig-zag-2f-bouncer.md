Keeps small marbles from getting stuck when falling from [Lower Zig Zag 3F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-3-ban/) to [Lower Zig Zag 2F](/parts/lower-zig-zag-2-ban/).  I realize now I didn't actually test it by seeing where marbles get stuck, but hopefully someone will test it before gluing.

History:

* 2020 Jun 09: I discovered a circular piece should do the job
perfectly.  I put the piece aside along with date and label into a bag for the Construction Crew to deliver later.

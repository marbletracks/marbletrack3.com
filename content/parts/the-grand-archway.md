[The First Track](/parts/the_first_track/) and the
[Front Left Medium Landing Zone](/parts/front_left_medium_landing_zone/)
arrive close to each other under the
[Outer Spiral](/parts/outer_spiral/).  There is precious little room
for outer spiral supports between the two that are there.

Welcome The Grand Archway, which will support the
[Outer Spiral](/parts/outer_spiral/) while spanning the landing areas
for [The First Track](/parts/the_first_track/) and the
[Front Left Medium Landing Zone](/parts/front_left_medium_landing_zone/).

The Grand Archway has to fit the space so it's tall enough to support the [Outer Spiral](/parts/outer_spiral/),
and wide enough to allow me to grab marbles from [The First Track](/parts/the_first_track/) and the
[Front Left Medium Landing Zone](/parts/front_left_medium_landing_zone/)

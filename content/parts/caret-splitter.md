The Caret Splitter sits opposite the (top of the) [Triple Splitter](/parts/triple_splitter/).  It is the small section of track which spans the end of the medium marble resting point which does *not* involve the [Triple Splitter](/parts/triple_splitter/).  I named it Caret Splitter because it is shaped like vaguely like a caret ^.  It is actually shaped more like the Japanese character „Å∏, when viewed from the direction the marbles will reach it.

Marbles arriving at the Caret Splitter
will be
sorted with the [Caret Splitter Rudder](/parts/caret-splitter-rudder/), which is attached to the [Caret Splitter Rudder Lever Spinner](/parts/caret-splitter-rudder-lever-spinner/), atop of which
will be
the [Caret Splitter Lever](/parts/caret-splitter-lever/).

The plan is to use the [Caret Splitter Rudder](/parts/caret-splitter-rudder/)
to push medium medium marbles toward the left
and small marbles
toward the right or left, as they like.

Because the medium marbles cannot go to the right, they must set
the [Caret Splitter Rudder](/parts/caret-splitter-rudder/)
to only send them to the left when they arrive at the Caret Splitter.


#### Construction History

* 2019 Feb 26: Augmented with [Caret Splitter Right Hand Inner Side](/parts/caret-splitter-right-hand-inner-side/).

[![2019 feb 26 caret splitter with right hand inner side](//b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/track/parts/2019/thumbs/2019_feb_26_caret_splitter_with_right_hand_inner_side.jpg)](//b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/track/parts/2019/2019_feb_26_caret_splitter_with_right_hand_inner_side.jpg)


* 22 Feb 2019 [Reversible Guy](/workers/reversible/) brought [Caret Splitter Right Hand Inner Side](/parts/caret-splitter-right-hand-inner-side/) to Caret Splitter Right Track

* 25 Dec 2018: Added [Bar Below Circle by Caret Splitter](/parts/bar_below_circle_by_the_caret_splitter/) which will keep small marbles on track.
* 17 Dec 2018: Added [Circle by Caret Splitter](/parts/circle_by_the_caret_splitter/) which will hold a bar to keep small marbles on track.
* Nov 2018: The medium marbles work perfectly (~100% of the time), but [the small marbles work 0% of the time](/episode/2018/november/glued-two-more-toothpicks-on-lower-zig-zag/).  If the small marbles hit the left side, they fall willy nilly.  If they hit the right side, they get stuck.

## Marble Track 3

Hugo source for marbletrack3.com

Includes file creation scripts, including:

`deploy.sh` uses YouTube API to get information about latest live streams

`generate-md-for-new-frames.pl`
create episodes based on a template (in my Emacs directory), today's date, YouTube data, image names

N.B. The scripts above require data from outside this repository.
